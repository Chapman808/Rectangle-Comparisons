##Intersections:

###Assumptions:
	1. parallel segments cannot intersect
	2. all segments are perpendicular or parallel
	3. segments can intersect at their terminating points

Rectangles A and B intersect at every point that side of A and the two perpendicular sides of B have in common. So A has eight opportunities for intersection:

>A_left and B_top
>A_left and B_bottom
>A_right and B_top
>A_right and B_bottom
vA_top and B_left
>A_top and B_right
>A_bottom and B_left
>A_bottom and B_right
